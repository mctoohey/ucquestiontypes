# ucquestiontypes
Selected University of Canterbury CodeRunner question types plus support files.

## Contents
Each folder contains an xml export of a question type (i.e. a prototype)
plus the various support files it uses and its template file.
You should be able to simply import the xml file into the question bank.
The support files and the template are within it and are available
separately only for convenience in editing, updating and viewing. 

Instructions for using the various question types are, as usual, within the prototype.
You can either edit the prototype file to read the Question text (which is the documentation)
or create a new question of that type and expand the *Show details* section.

Warning: it is quite possible that the support files will be updated more regularly
than the xml export. So if you want to guarantee to have the latest version, please
first check the date of the export (which is within the filename) and compare with
the modification dates on the support files. Replace any updated support files
within the prototype.

## Disclaimer
This repository is primarily for in-house use by the University of Canterbury
but anyone else is of course welcome to use the question types. If you need
support you can try posting to the CodeRunner question author's forum, but
please realise that these question types are not a supported part of
CodeRunner itself, so no support is guaranteed.
